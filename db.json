It\u2019s no fuss, no gimmicks - just tried and true honest hospitality. From the second a guest steps in the lobby, it becomes a warm and welcoming hub where they can start the day with a perfect latte, and end it by swapping adventure stories at the outdoor hot tubs before retiring for the night to do it all over again. Pair this with the Lodge\u2019s legacy of being independently owned by the same family for generations, and the comforting touches from homemade focaccia to fresh soup at Whitebark, and it becomes nothing short of a home away from home.\n\nCharming, modern and minimalistic, Banff Aspen Lodge is a jewel in the Rockies where the staff care, and the guests can feel it. This is where people come to feel like a local - the ideal location for setting up a base camp, where access to everything is steps way, but still far enough removed to enjoy peace and quiet at the end of the day.",
